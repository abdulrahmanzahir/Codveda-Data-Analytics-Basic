# 🎨 Task 3 — Data Visualization

## 📝 Overview
This task focuses on turning insights from the Iris dataset into **clear, reusable visuals**.  
Unlike EDA, which explores, this step emphasizes **communication and presentation quality**.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Create **bar**, **line**, and **scatter** plots
- Customize labels, titles, and legends for clarity
- Export plots as images for reports

## 🛠️ What I Built
- 📊 **Species Count (Bar Plot):** shows class balance
- 📈 **Average Feature Values (Line Chart):** mean of each feature per species
- 🔁 **Pairplot (Scatter):** feature relationships, color-coded by species
- 🧰 **Boxplots:** distribution & outliers per feature per species
- 🧱 **Histograms:** overall feature distributions

## ✅ Summary
Petal features provide the clearest visual separation between species, while sepal features show more overlap.  
All figures were saved for inclusion in reports and future modeling work.
